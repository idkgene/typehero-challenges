## Understanding the `MyExclude` Type

**Problem:**

The goal is to implement a TypeScript utility type, `MyExclude<T, U>`, that mimics the built-in `Exclude<T, U>` type.  This type should take two union types, `T` and `U`, and return a new union type containing only the members of `T` that are *not* assignable to any of the members of `U`.

**Initial State (Default Tests):**

Here's the initial state of the tests we need to pass:

```typescript
import type { Equal, Expect } from '@type-challenges/utils'
import type { MyExclude } from './1.ts'

type cases = [
  Expect<Equal<MyExclude<'a' | 'b' | 'c', 'a'>, 'b' | 'c'>>,
  Expect<Equal<MyExclude<'a' | 'b' | 'c', 'a' | 'b'>, 'c'>>,
  Expect<Equal<MyExclude<string | number | (() => void), Function>, string | number>>,
]
```

In this setup:

- `Expect<Equal<MyExclude<'a' | 'b' | 'c', 'a'>, 'b' | 'c'>>`: This test checks if `MyExclude` correctly excludes the literal type `'a'` from the union `'a' | 'b' | 'c'`, resulting in `'b' | 'c'`.
- `Expect<Equal<MyExclude<'a' | 'b' | 'c', 'a' | 'b'>, 'c'>>`: This test checks if `MyExclude` correctly excludes both `'a'` and `'b'` from the union `'a' | 'b' | 'c'`, resulting in `'c'`.
- `Expect<Equal<MyExclude<string | number | (() => void), Function>, string | number>>`: This test checks if `MyExclude` correctly excludes the function type `(() => void)` from the union `string | number | (() => void)` because `(() => void)` is assignable to `Function`. The result should be `string | number`.

The initial `MyExclude` type is simply `any`, which will pass the tests but doesn't implement the desired logic:

```typescript
type MyExclude<T, U> = any
```

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

Let's break down the correct implementation of `MyExclude<T, U>`:

```typescript
export type MyExclude<T, U> = T extends U ? never : T
```

1.  **`export type MyExclude<T, U> =`:**
    - This declares a generic type named `MyExclude` with two type parameters: `T` and `U`.

2.  **`T extends U ? never : T`:**
    - This is a conditional type. It checks if each individual type within the union `T` is assignable to the union `U`.
    - **`T extends U`:** This part iterates through each member of the union type `T`. For each member, it checks if that member is assignable to any of the types in the union `U`.
    - **`? never`:** If a member of `T` *is* assignable to a member of `U`, the result for that specific member is `never`. The `never` type represents a type that will never occur, and when used in a union, it is effectively removed.
    - **`: T`:** If a member of `T` is *not* assignable to any member of `U`, the result for that specific member is the member itself.

**How it Works with Examples:**

Let's apply this logic to the test cases:

- **`MyExclude<'a' | 'b' | 'c', 'a'>`:**
    - `'a' extends 'a'` is true, so it becomes `never`.
    - `'b' extends 'a'` is false, so it remains `'b'`.
    - `'c' extends 'a'` is false, so it remains `'c'`.
    - The resulting union is `never | 'b' | 'c'`, which simplifies to `'b' | 'c'`.

- **`MyExclude<'a' | 'b' | 'c', 'a' | 'b'>`:**
    - `'a' extends 'a' | 'b'` is true, so it becomes `never`.
    - `'b' extends 'a' | 'b'` is true, so it becomes `never`.
    - `'c' extends 'a' | 'b'` is false, so it remains `'c'`.
    - The resulting union is `never | never | 'c'`, which simplifies to `'c'`.

- **`MyExclude<string | number | (() => void), Function>`:**
    - `string extends Function` is false, so it remains `string`.
    - `number extends Function` is false, so it remains `number`.
    - `(() => void) extends Function` is true, so it becomes `never`.
    - The resulting union is `string | number | never`, which simplifies to `string | number`.
