## Understanding the &quot;Hello, World!&quot; Type Challenge

**Problem:**

The goal of this TypeScript Type Challenge is to define a type alias named `HelloWorld` that is precisely the `string` type.  The challenge uses type system assertions to verify the correctness of your solution.

**Initial State (Default):**

```typescript
type HelloWorld = any // expected to be a string
```

The initial definition sets `HelloWorld` to `any`. While this would technically allow any string value to be assigned to it, it doesn't satisfy the requirement of being *exactly* the `string` type and also fails the `NotAny` check.

**Tests:**

```typescript
import type { Equal, Expect, NotAny } from '@type-challenges/utils'

type cases = [
  Expect<NotAny<HelloWorld>>,
  Expect<Equal<HelloWorld, string>>,
]
```

The tests define an array of `cases`, each using the `Expect` utility type to assert a condition.

1.  **`Expect<NotAny<HelloWorld>>`**: This test uses the `NotAny` utility type. `NotAny<T>` ensures that the type `T` is not the `any` type.  This is important because `any` bypasses TypeScript's type checking and is generally discouraged for precise type definitions.

2.  **`Expect<Equal<HelloWorld, string>>`**: This test uses the `Equal` utility type. `Equal<A, B>` checks if type `A` is exactly equal to type `B`. In this case, it verifies that our `HelloWorld` type is precisely the `string` type.

**Solution:**

```typescript
export type HelloWorld = string
```

**Explanation:**

The solution is straightforward:

1.  **`export type HelloWorld`**: This declares a type alias named `HelloWorld`. The `export` keyword makes this type available for use in other modules if needed.

2.  **`= string`**: This assigns the `string` primitive type to the `HelloWorld` alias. This means that `HelloWorld` is now a direct synonym for the built-in `string` type in TypeScript.

**How it Works:**

By setting `HelloWorld` to `string`, we satisfy both test conditions:

1.  **`Expect<NotAny<HelloWorld>>` passes**: Since `HelloWorld` is now `string`, it is no longer the `any` type.

2.  **`Expect<Equal<HelloWorld, string>>` passes**:  Because we explicitly defined `HelloWorld` as `string`, the `Equal` utility type confirms that they are indeed the same type.
