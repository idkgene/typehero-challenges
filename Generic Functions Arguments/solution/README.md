## Understanding the `identity` Function

**Problem:**

The goal is to create a generic `identity` function that takes an argument of any type and returns that same argument without modification.  The type of the returned value should be the same as the type of the input value.

**Initial State (Default):**

```typescript
const identity = undefined;
```

**Solution:**

```typescript
const identity = <T>(arg: T) => arg;
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`const identity = <T>`:** This introduces the generic type parameter `T` for the `identity` function.  The `<T>` part signifies that this function is generic and can work with different types.  `T` acts as a placeholder for a specific type that will be determined when the function is called.

2.  **`(arg: T)`:** This defines the function's parameter named `arg`. The type of `arg` is specified as `T`, which is the generic type parameter we just declared. This means the `identity` function can accept an argument of any type.

3.  **`=> arg`:** This is the function's body. It simply returns the `arg` that was passed in.

**How it Works:**

When you call the `identity` function, TypeScript infers the specific type for `T` based on the argument you provide.

*   If you call `identity(&quot;this is a string&quot;)`, TypeScript infers `T` to be `&quot;this is a string&quot;` (or more generally `string`). The function then returns the string, and its type is correctly inferred as `&quot;this is a string&quot;` (or `string`).
*   If you call `identity(123.45)`, TypeScript infers `T` to be `123.45` (or `number`). The function returns the number, and its type is correctly inferred as `123.45` (or `number`).
*   And so on for other types like booleans.

The generic type parameter `T` ensures that the function maintains the type of the input argument in its output, making it type-safe for various data types.

## Understanding the `mapArray` Function

**Problem:**

The goal is to create a generic `mapArray` function that takes an array and a mapping function as arguments. It should apply the mapping function to each element of the input array and return a new array containing the results.  The types of the elements in the input and output arrays can be different.

**Initial State (Default):**

```typescript
const mapArray = (arr, fn) => arr.map(fn);
```

**Solution:**

```typescript
const mapArray = <T, U>(arr: T[], fn: (item: T) => U): U[] => arr.map(fn);
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`const mapArray = <T, U>`:** This introduces two generic type parameters for the `mapArray` function: `T` and `U`.
    *   `T` will represent the type of the elements in the input array.
    *   `U` will represent the type of the elements in the output array (the result of the mapping function).

2.  **`(arr: T[])`:** This defines the first parameter, `arr`, which represents the input array. The type of `arr` is specified as `T[]`, meaning it's an array where each element is of type `T` (the first generic type parameter).

3.  **`fn: (item: T) => U`:** This defines the second parameter, `fn`, which is the mapping function.
    *   `(item: T)`: This specifies that the `fn` function takes one argument named `item`, and its type is `T` (the type of the elements in the input array).
    *   `=> U`: This specifies that the `fn` function returns a value of type `U` (the second generic type parameter, which represents the type of elements in the output array).

4.  **`: U[]`:** This specifies the return type of the `mapArray` function. It indicates that the function will return an array where each element is of type `U`.

5.  **`=> arr.map(fn)`:** This is the function's body. It uses the built-in `map` method of arrays to apply the provided `fn` function to each element of the `arr` array and returns the new array.

**How it Works:**

When you call the `mapArray` function, TypeScript infers the specific types for `T` and `U` based on the arguments you provide.

*   In `mapArray(strings, str => parseInt(str))`:
    *   `strings` is of type `string[]`, so TypeScript infers `T` to be `string`.
    *   The mapping function `str => parseInt(str)` takes a `string` and returns a `number`, so TypeScript infers `U` to be `number`.
    *   The return type of `mapArray` is then correctly inferred as `number[]`.

*   In `mapArray(numbers, num => \`${num}\`)`:
    *   `numbers` is of type `number[]`, so TypeScript infers `T` to be `number`.
    *   The mapping function `num => \`${num}\`` takes a `number` and returns a `string`, so TypeScript infers `U` to be `string`.
    *   The return type of `mapArray` is then correctly inferred as `string[]`.

The use of generic type parameters `T` and `U` allows the `mapArray` function to work with arrays of any type and to transform them into arrays of potentially different types, all while maintaining type safety.
