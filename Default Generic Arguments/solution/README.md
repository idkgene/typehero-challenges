## Understanding the `ApiRequest` Type

**Problem:**

The goal is to create a TypeScript generic type, `ApiRequest<Data, Method>`, that represents an API request. This type should have two generic parameters: `Data` representing the type of the request data and `Method` representing the HTTP method used for the request.  We want the `Method` to have a default value of `&quot;GET&quot;` so that users don't have to specify it for simple GET requests. The `Method` should also be constrained to be either `&quot;GET&quot;` or `&quot;POST&quot;`.

**Initial State (Default Tests):**

Here's the initial state of the tests we need to pass:

```typescript
import { Expect, Equal } from 'type-testing';
import type { ApiRequest } from './1.ts';

type test_ApiRequest_explicitPost = Expect<
  Equal<ApiRequest<string, 'POST'>, { data: string; method: 'POST' }>
>;

type test_ApiRequest_implicitGet = Expect<
  Equal<ApiRequest<number>, { data: number; method: 'GET' }>
>;
```

In this setup:

- `test_ApiRequest_explicitPost` checks if `ApiRequest<string, 'POST'>` correctly resolves to `{ data: string; method: 'POST' }`. This tests the case where the `Method` is explicitly provided.
- `test_ApiRequest_implicitGet` checks if `ApiRequest<number>` correctly resolves to `{ data: number; method: 'GET' }`. This tests the default value of the `Method` generic.

bot's message: - `test_TSConfig_true` checks if `TSConfig<{ strict: true }>` resolves to `{ strict: true }`, ensuring that providing an explicit `strict: true` works correctly.
- `test_TSConfig_false` checks if `TSConfig<{ strict: false }>` resolves to `{ strict: false }`, ensuring that providing an explicit `strict: false` works correctly.
- `test_TSConfig_boolean` checks if `TSConfig<{ strict: boolean }>` resolves to `{ strict: boolean }`, ensuring that providing a `strict` property with the more general `boolean` type works correctly.

The initial `TSConfig` type is simply `unknown`, which will pass the tests but doesn't implement the desired logic:

```typescript
type TSConfig = unknown;
```

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

Let's break down the correct implementation of `TSConfig<Config>`:

```typescript
export type TSConfig<Config extends { strict: boolean } = { strict : true }> = Config;
```

1.  **`export type TSConfig<Config extends { strict: boolean } = { strict : true }>`:**
    - This declares a generic type named `TSConfig` with one type parameter: `Config`.
    - **`extends { strict: boolean }`:** This adds a constraint to the `Config` type parameter. It specifies that `Config` must be an object that has at least a property named `strict` with a type of `boolean`. This ensures that any configuration passed to `TSConfig` has the necessary `strict` property.
    - **`= { strict : true }`:** This provides a default value for the `Config` type parameter. If a user uses `TSConfig` without specifying any type arguments, `Config` will default to the object `{ strict: true }`.

2.  **`=`:**
    - This indicates that we are defining the structure of the `TSConfig` type.

3.  **`Config`:**
    - This simply means that the `TSConfig` type itself is equivalent to the `Config` type parameter.  This allows us to pass in specific configuration objects as type arguments and have `TSConfig` represent that specific configuration.
